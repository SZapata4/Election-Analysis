# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Project
 A Colorado Board of Elections employees has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional race.

1.	Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3.	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4.	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5.	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6.	Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
7.	Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of total count.
8.	Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary

After using this script to analysis this local election, I believe that the election committee can use this script for any election. There would only need to be a few modifications. I believe this could easily be used in a presidential election by modifying counties with states. This script could also be scaled down to something like a school board voting where all we would need to change was counties to school districts. Looking at these two examples I think it is easy to see how use this script can be in any election analysis setting.
